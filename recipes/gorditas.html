  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Gorditas are a traditional Mexican dish made from thick, round corn dough that is cooked on a griddle or deep-fried.
    The dough is typically made from masa harina, a special corn flour, and can be stuffed or topped with a variety of fillings such as shredded meat, beans, cheese, or salsa.
    Gorditas are known for their crispy outside and soft, warm inside, offering a satisfying taste of Mexican street food.
