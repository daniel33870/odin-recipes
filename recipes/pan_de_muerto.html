  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Pan de Muerto is a traditional Mexican bread typically made for the Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) celebration.
    It is a soft, sweet bread flavored with orange blossom or anise, and it is often decorated with bone-shaped dough pieces on top to represent the cycle of life and death.
    This bread is enjoyed by families during the holiday as part of the altars (ofrendas) honoring loved ones who have passed away.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon orange blossom water (optional)</li>
    <li>Additional sugar for dusting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and orange zest. Add the yeast mixture, warm milk, eggs, and butter.</li>
    <li>Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a cloth, and let it rise for about 1 to 2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and shape it into a round loaf. Use a small portion of the dough to create bone-shaped decorations on top.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Let the shaped dough rise again for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown. Let it cool slightly before brushing with melted butter and sprinkling sugar on top.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your Pan de Muerto as part of your Día de los Muertos celebration!</li>
